## 📊 Content Management

This portfolio dynamically fetches articles and books from a GitHub repository:

- **Articles**: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ozzgio/portfolio-data/main/articles.json`
- **Books**: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ozzgio/portfolio-data/main/books.json`

Content is managed in a private Obsidian vault and automatically synced to the public data repository via GitHub Actions. This allows for:
- Writing content in Obsidian (markdown)
- Automatic JSON generation on content updates
- No API keys or external services required
- Full control over content and versioning

See the [portfolio-data repository](https://github.com/ozzgio/portfolio-data) for the public JSON files.
